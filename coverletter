I usually do not submit cover letters because they are a one-way recitation about me. 
To help you, I need to know a bit more than what’s in the job description — 
about the pain points an gain points you need your new hire to tackle. 
I’d be glad to invest in a 10-minute call to discuss this. 
Based on a preliminary assessment of your business, and on what you tell me during our call, 
I believe there may be one or two things I can bring to the job that would directly affect the success of your operation. 
If I can’t demonstrate that during our brief talk, then you should of course not interview or hire me. 
Would you like to schedule 10 minutes to discuss ?
